Virtual Memory Simulator
-------------------------
In local page replacement, each process is allocated a certain number of physical memory frames. Once a page needs to be evicted, the victim page is selected among the pages of the same process. In this project, I simulated the Least Recently Used (LRU) and Optimal (OPT) replacement algorithms by reading traces of memory references that were generated by two processes while running on a 32-bit system and collecting relevant metrics. Because it is local page replacement algorithm, each process has its own frames (i.e., a percentage of the total available physical memory). While simulating the algorithm, I collected statistics about its performance, such as the number of page faults that occur and the number of dirty frames that had to be written back to disk.=
